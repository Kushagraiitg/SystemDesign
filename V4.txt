Non-Relational DBs
- Not relationally structured
- Give options to horizontal scale and availability by providing eventual consistency
- no complete downtime almost never
- sharding -> scaling

Document DBs (MongoDB, ElasticSearch)
- Mostly json based
- supports complex queries
- Partial updates to documents available
- closest to relation DBs like a generic RDB

Key Value Store (Redis, DynamoDB, Aerospike)
- Key wise access pattern -> makes sharding easy
- so heavily partitioned
- complex queries not supported
- cross partition operations are expensive

Column Oriented DBs (Redshift)
- utilize the query pattern of users
- eg stock ticks
- for queries like avg(price), lookup is very easy
- more oppurtunities to compress, 29X kinda, cause of homogeneous nature of data
Foundational paper : C-store

Graph DB
- stores data in node and edges
- for social behaviours and recommendations
- store adjacency relationship
- specialized in graph operations
eg: Neo4j, Neptune, DGraph, TigerGraph 

Why non-relational DBs scale
- There are no relations
- data can be denormalized
- data is modelled to be sharded

When SQL
	- ACID  
	- relation, constraints
	
When noSQL
	- No relation
	- data can be denormalized
