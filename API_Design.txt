A RESTful web API implementation is a web API that employs Representational State Transfer (REST) architectural principles to achieve a stateless, loosely coupled interface between a client and service. A web API that is RESTful supports the standard HTTP protocol to perform operations on resources and return representations of resources that contain hypermedia links and HTTP operation status codes.
- Platform Independence
	- HTTP protocol
	- JSON/XML
- Loose Coupling
RESTful web API design concepts
- URI: eg https://api.contoso.com/orders/1
- Resourece representation: how a resource that's identified by its URI is encoded and transported over the HTTP protocol in a specific format, such as XML or JSON
- the uniform interface includes using standard HTTP verbs to perform operations like GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE on resources.
- Stateless Request Model
- Hypermedia links


- Defining REST API URIs
	- use nouns and not words
	- HTTP response for success/failure
	- plural nouns
	- Consider the relationships between different types of resources and how you might expose these associations
		- use hyperlinks as reqd
	- keep relationship simple and flexible
		- not more complex than `collection/item/collection`
	- maintain balance between large number of small resources (normalized vs denormalized)
	- dont expose internal system
	
- Define RESTful web API methods
	- GET request:  GET request retrieves a representation of the resource at the specified URI. The body of the response message contains the details of the requested resource.
		- can responde 200. 204(No content), 404(resource not found)
	- Post request:  POST requests are used to add a new resource to the collection that the URI identifies
		- 200, 201(Created), 204, 400(Bad request), 405(Method not allowed)
	- PUT request: update/create- msut be idempotent
		- 200,201,204,409(Conflict)
	- PATCH request: partial update for existing resources
		- 200, 400, 409, 415(Unsupported media type)
	- DELETE request: removes the resource at specified URI
		- 204,404
-Resource MIME type
	- Resource representation is how a resource that's identified by URI is encoded and transported over the HTTP protocol in a specific format, such as XML or JSON.
- Asynchronous methods
	- An asynchronous method should return HTTP status code 202 (Accepted) to indicate that the request was accepted for processing but is incomplete.
	- 303 if a new resource is created
- Pagination and Filtering
	- To optimize data retrieval and reduce payload size, implement data pagination and query-based filtering in your API design. 
	- Pagination
		- `limit` and `offset`
 	- Filtering: x=sth&y=sth2
 - Support partial response: A HEAD request is similar to a GET request, except that it only returns the HTTP headers that describe the resource, with an empty message body. A client application can issue a HEAD request to determine whether to fetch a resource by using partial GET requests
